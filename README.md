## Results

Results of text classification experiments in terms of classification error rate on the AG’s News, DBPedia, and Yelp Review
Polarity datasets. The first two methods are the state-of-the-art models without using any unsupervised data. The last four networks are proposed in this work.

| Models          | AG's News | DBPedia | Yelp Polarity
|-----------------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Word-level CNN  | 8.55\%    | 1.37\%  | 4.60\% 
| Char-level CNN  | 9.51\%    | 1.55\%  | 4.88\% 
| GCN-Net         | 8.64\%    | 1.69\%  | 7.74\% 
| GCN-gPool-Net   | 8.09\%    | 1.44\%  | 5.82\% 
| hConv-Net       | 7.49\%    | 1.02\%  | 4.45\% 
| hConv-gPool-Net | 7.09\%    | 0.92\%  | 4.37\%
